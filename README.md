# BFN - Bullshit-Free News on your command line #

Getting tired of flashy animations, noisy audio streams and unnerving
advertisement when you just want to read the news and have a cup of
coffee? BFN is here for the rescue. If your favourite news webpages
feature an RSS feed (which they most probably do), BFN can scan for 
the latest news, ask you, whether or not you find the found articles
interesting, extract the texts from the webpages and print them on
the command line. That way, you get updated and not distracted.

BFN is written in the Ruby programming language. It should be
executable on Linux, Windows and MacOS alike. However since I am a
Linux afficionado, I have no other OS and did not test it on any
other platform. Feel free to do so.

## Installing ##
You need [nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html) installed.
Follow the tutorial or search your Linux distribution's
repositories.
